# Sightengine API Ruby Wrapper

This gem provides a ruby API to the [Sightengine image moderation service](https://sightengine.com/).

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ello/sightengine-ruby.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ello/sightengine-ruby)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sightengine-ruby', github: 'ello/sightengine-ruby', require: 'sightengine'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle


## Usage

Before making any calls, you'll need to set your credentials using the `SIGHTENGINE_API_USER` and `SIGHTENGINE_API_SECRET` environment variables.

The Sightengine API has one call - `moderate`, which [checks an image for nudity](https://sightengine.readme.io/docs/nudityjson) and returns an evaluation of it.

```ruby
  puts Sightengine.moderate('https://unsplash.it/200/300?random')
  #<struct Sightengine::Response status="success", nudity_result=false, nudity_confidence=66>
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `rake` to run the tests. 

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

If you're adding new calls to Sightengine, running tests may require a valid API user ID and secret as described above. Normal test runs are stubbed via VCR, and should not require credentials.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
